This project was completed in the fall semester for SENG 550 at the university of Calgary

The project uses
- Apache Spark
- Machine Learn
- Sentiment analysis


The goal of the project was to determine if a songs text infomaiton could be used to predict the genre of the song. The project served as a introduction to Spark and Machine Learning. 

The PDF report details the project and the outcome. The notebook contains the code set up by Chace Nielson to create a spark context using song data, extracting features and running machine learning. Addition graphics are also found in the notebook.

The project requires a file containing sentiment analysis data and the CSV file containing song data. It was also initially set up to run in a google colab and mount to a google drive.
